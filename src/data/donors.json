Over the course of his time in office, O’Farrell’s taken more than half a million dollars from real estate interests. About 75% of O’Farrell’s cash comes from donors giving the maximum legal amount. It’s clear how real estate influences how MItch governs, and that every election, O’Farrell falls deeper into the pocket of real estate. Affordable and public housing doesn’t get built, but luxury apartments do. The unhoused don’t get permanent housing as eviction rates increase. Mitch governs on behalf of wealthy property owners, not renters or workers.",

O’Farrell also happily takes money from Live Nation, a media corporation rapidly buying up small venues and charging outrageous ticket fees. O’Farrell closed Echo Park to public use but always finds a way to allow studios to get permits to film in the park. Mitch puts permits over people!",

At minimum, many council members are deeply complicit in it, and at worst: they’re actively involved while somewhat less ostentatious than Huizar. A simple look at Mitch O’Farrell’s campaign contributions reveals a cast of the same characters connected with Huizar’s infamous dealings. For those who needs a quick primer on the Huizar situation, the short version is: real estate developers facilitated a racketeering scheme with the help of sitting city council members and insiders to fast track their developments through planning committees between as early as 2013 through 2020. This was deeply illegal, unethical, and led to Mitch Englander (former CD12 Council Member), Jose Huizar, along with his aide (George Esparza), a member of Garcetti’s staff (Raymond Chan), and a handful of developers being indicted on federal bribery charges.",

In short, the current Airbnb model incentivizes landlords to push out tenants who need affordable housing in exchance for tourists who can pay higher amounts for a short term stay- and Mitch won't do anything about it.

Airbnb rakes in profits from illegal rentals that, according to a study done in Los Angeles, \"cause rent increases, reduce the housing supply, and exacerbate segregation.\" In return for their donations, Mitch has consistently argued to loosen restrictions on short term rentals in order to benefit white, wealthy landowners at the expense of renters. Airbnb also reduces tax revenue to cities that would have come from lodging taxes and squeezes partying travelers into quiet residential neighborhoods and apartments. And workers who clean short term rentals lack even the inadequate labor protections afforded to hotel workers. ",
