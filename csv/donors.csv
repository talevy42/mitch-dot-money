Want the best terms for your towing impound lot? What about a big juicy city contract for your waste hauling business? Just hire the lobbying firm of Englander Knabe and Allen (EKA). Founding EKA partner Harvey Englander's nephew Mitchell Englander just got out of jail, where he served 14 months for taking bribes from developers while partying in Las Vegas and Palm Springs.

TRUE,Kilroy Realty L.P.,Real Estate,Los Angeles,"$9,450.00","PAC $25,000",Huge real estate developer bankrolling a regressive anti-tax ballot initiative,"Kilroy Realty is a real estate investment trust that owns, develops, acquires and manages luxury real estate assets in Los Angeles, and spends lavishly on conservative leaning politicians and causes. They are one of Mitch’s top donors, and rely on Council approval for their projects. They are also supporters of the “Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act” ballot initiative, which may be on this November’s ballot, crafted by the California Business Roundtable. The deceptively named initiative will make it almost impossible to tax wealthy developers, a clear attempt to crush progressive efforts like the United to House LA ballot initiative which would tax real estate transactions over $5 million to fund affordable housing construction and enforce tenant protections.",https://i.imgur.com/roC29IL.png,"Kilroy is financing a ballot initiative to make it impossible to raise taxes.

The deceptively named “Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act” is a ballot intuitive on this November’s ballot, crafted by the California Business Roundtable. It will make it almost impossible to tax wealthy developers to fund much needed municipal services. Who’s funding this initiative? No surprise here: wealthy developers. Kilroy Realty contributed $1 million towards the effort and is also one of Mitch’s top campaign contributors over the years.

Meet Mitch fanboy Matthew Klink, a Republican strategist and lobbyist for all the sleaziest causes, tobacco, casinos, luxury developments, oil and gas companies.

TRUE,Jennifer LoGrande,"Lobbyists, Real Estate",Long Beach,$800,,Wife of unethical revolving door lobbyist,"While Michael LoGrande was being paid $18,000 a month by the City of LA Planning department, he was simultaneously and illegally lobbying on behalf of developers with projects all over the city. As the former planning director for LA, it’s strictly forbidden to lobby city officials within a year of leaving his job. The Ethics Commision fined LoGrande $281,250, the largest fine ever for a former city employee. It is also an ethical violation to donate to Mitch, but LoGrande is not one to play by the rules when it comes to doing the dirty work for his developer clients, so he laundered his contribution through his wife Jennifer LoGrande. One of his clients, Vella Group, also generously lines Mitch’s pockets.",https://i.imgur.com/if2V7Gy.png,"While Michael LoGrande was being paid $18,000 a month by the City of LA Planning department, he was simultaneously and illegally lobbying on behalf of developers with projects all over the city.

While other cities have banned single-use styrofoam containers in restaurants, Mitch was happy to take that sweet sweet styrofoam money and pass a softer “plastic utensils on request” ordinance. We know Mitch likes the appearance of doing something, while allowing Big Plastic industries to fill our waterways with plastic particles that will circulate for eternity.",https://i.imgur.com/86dVkzr.png,"While other cities have banned single-use styrofoam containers in restaurants, Mitch was happy to take that sweet sweet styrofoam money from Dart Container and delay a full ban. 
LA is behind way behind other cities such as Seattle which banned styrofoam containers back in 2009 and and San Francisco which enacted a ban in 2017. Mitch’s styrofoam patron Kenneth Dart, the secretive billionaire behind Dart Container, renounced his U.S. citizenship and lives tax free in the Cayman Islands where he’s the only resident of a massive hotel when he’s not out on his torpedo proof yacht.

His tactics are so egregious that in December of 2019, the Los Angeles Tenants Union organized an action against him called “Fari Moshfegh, Slumlord!” for his continued abuse. The list of tactics he uses to force tenants out is long but includes illegal construction, stealing tenants’ stoves, stealing their heaters, breaking into tenant’s apartments unannounced, physically threatening tenants, refusing to make repairs for years, and intimidating tenants into accepting cash for keys.” As LATU puts it, “Fari Moshfegh has tried every trick in the book to evict his tenants.""",https://i.imgur.com/xFqruVF.png,"“Fari Moshfegh, Slumlord!” Days before the protest, Moshfegh handed out Ellis Act eviction notices in a latest attempt to remove tenants and build a ten-story luxury hotel.
